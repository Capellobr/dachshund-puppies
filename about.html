            <h2>ABOUT OUR DACHSHUND FOR SALE AS A BREED</h2>
            <P>The term "icon" is overused, but the Dachshund, with his distinct long-backed physique, short legs, and large personality, is truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard (weighing 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature (weighing 11 pounds or less) in one of three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired. Dachshunds aren't intended for long distance running, leaping, or swimming, yet these tireless dogs are up for anything. They make excellent watchdogs because they are intelligent and vigilant, and they have a big-dog bark. They were bred to be independent hunters of difficult game, and they can be fearless to the point of rashness and a little stubborn, but their lovable character and unusual appearance has earned millions of hearts throughout the world. It is critical that a Dachshund is not let to become overweight. This is done not only for general health reasons, but also to prevent tension on the Dachshund's long back, which can result in slipping or ruptured (herniated) discs. Ignore the imploring eyes and feed only the amount recommended by the maker of the high-quality dog food of your choice. Table scraps should be given sparingly, if at all, and should avoid cooked bones and high-fat items. Remember that the Dachshund's sniffer can lead him into trouble, so keep food out of his reach at all times. The "Wiener Dog" is astute, active, and brave. They have a pleasant, feisty, and inquisitive personality and get along well with children. Dachshunds are good watchdogs because they are vigilant, apprehensive of strangers, and have a "big-dog" bark. They are prone to barking, although early socialization and training can minimize this. They also have a strong prey drive, which can be a problem for smaller animals in the home if not properly socialized with them. They are, however, normally amicable to other dogs.</P>
            <h3>HEALTH GUARANTEE</h3>
            <P>We are proud that our relationship with you does not end when you purchase a dachshund puppy from us. As a responsible dachshund breeder, expert dachshund puppy counselors, and puppy enthusiasts, we'd like to believe that nothing can ever go wrong with our dachshundpuppies. Certain things, however, are never under our control. A puppy's health is determined by a variety of factors, including genetics, exercise, diet and nutrition, and overall care. If something goes wrong, we always try to help, even if our warranty doesn't cover it. While we cannot guarantee that your puppy will never have a health condition, we can guarantee that we will do all possible to ensure that your new family member is healthy! We do not believe your dog can be replaced, but we do believe that in the companionship of another furry buddy, the pain can be alleviated. In the odd event that a puppy dies within two years of birth due to genetics, or if the puppy is discovered to have congenital or hereditary illnesses (within two years) that negatively affect your puppy's health, we will replace the pet with another of comparable value at no cost to you. A professional veterinarian should certify the cause of death.

                This warranty will be canceled if your puppy does not receive timely immunizations or regular veterinary treatment.
                
                
                
                This guarantee does not cover the costs of spaying or neutering, including undescended testes.</P>
                <p>Within ten days of purchasing your new puppy, you must take him/her to a licensed veterinarian for an examination. If the veterinarian determines, within ten days of purchase, that your dog is clinically ill or has died from an injury sustained or illness likely to have been contracted on or before the date of sale and delivery, you have the following options:<br>Return the dog for a complete refund.
                    Return the dog for a replacement dog of equal value.<br>
                    Retain the dog and receive reimbursement for reasonable veterinary fees, not exceeding the purchase price.<br>
                    These options do not apply where a seller, who has provided a health certificate issued by a veterinarian, discloses in writing at the time of sale the health problem for which the buyer later seeks to return the dog.<br>
                    If within 30 days of purchase, a licensed veterinarian determines that your dog has a congenital or hereditary defect that adversely affects the animal’s health or that your dog died from a congenital or hereditary defect, you have the same option as outlined above.<br>
                    You must notify the seller of the examining veterinarian’s name, address & phone number within two days of the vet’s certification of your dog’s illness. Failure to notify the seller within two business days will result in forfeiture of rights. Each state has different laws related to the sale of a puppy; please educate yourself on the laws in the state in which you purchase your puppy.<br>
                    
                    Each state in the U.S. has different guidelines in regards to guaranteed health for sold puppies. For states that do not have a mandatory health guarantee in place, any breeder advertising through our site is expected to cover the health of their puppies for at least 30 days. In the event that a state guideline is in place offering a guarantee longer than 30 days, that law holds precedence.<br>
                    
                    Some breeders offer extended guarantees on their puppies. It is not legal for a breeder to offer a health guarantee that is not at least equal to state law. For a more detailed description of extended genetic health guarantees, read <br>
                    
                    Extended Genetic Health Guarantees (when offered)<br>
                    
                    An additional guarantee specifically covers any disease or illness that is proven to be of a genetic origin through proper veterinary examination and testing.<br>
                    
                    These guarantees do not cover normal veterinary costs incurred while providing general care for the puppy.<br>
                    Proper documentation must be provided to the breeder before any compensation is paid.<br>
                    This guarantee does not cover any costs incurred related to injuries caused by owner negligence or accidental injury.</p>
